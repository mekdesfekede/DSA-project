 #  Social Media Network Analysis on Instagram

  Project Description

This project aims to analyze social media networks, focusing on Instagram. Using graph representation, the project models user interactions and relationships to identify patterns, trends, and potential insights. Operations such as adding nodes, deleting nodes, updating weights, adding edges, and structuring paths are implemented in C++.

 ### Features
Graph Representation:

Nodes represent Instagram users.

Edges represent interactions (e.g., likes, comments, follows).

Weights represent the intensity of interactions.

  ###  Operations:

  Add Node: Insert a new user into the graph.

Delete Node: Remove an existing user from the graph.

Add Edge: Create a relationship between two users.

Update Weight: Modify the strength of an interaction.

Path Structuring: Find structured paths between users or clusters.

  ### Technologies Used Technologies

Programming Language: C++

Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL), Graph-specific algorithms

Data Structures: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List

Version Control: Git & GitHub
